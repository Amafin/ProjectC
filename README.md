Project :
Doing a CDataFrame using the advanced method
So we can have columns with different types of data to have different types in different columns
For this we are using the "union" and the "enum"
To have a single column, we are using different functions to do so
A function to implement the column with a title, a size, a type of data ...
A function to add a value to the column if there is enough space in the column to add it
A function to free the column after freeing all the spaces used for this column
A function to display a value in the column
A function to display the whole column


Currently :

All the main functions of the column.c are working, but are accessed in the function of the dataframe.c

In dataframe.c, most of the main function are working, and are accessible when you launch the project


When you display the dataframe, or a part of it, you have to launch again the project to be able to display again the dataframe (every launch, you cannot display the dataframe more than one time)


 A Program to : 
implement
display
add a value
free a column

Two headers :
Header for only one column
Header for the CDataFrame
