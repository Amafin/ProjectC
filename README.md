Project :
Doing a CDataFrame using the advanced method
So we can have columns with different types of data to have different types in different columns
For this we are using the "union" and the "enum"
To have a single column, we are using different functions to do so
A function to implement the column with a title, a size, a type of data ...
A function to add a value to the column if there is enough space in the column to add it
A function to free the column after freeing all the spaces used for this column
A function to display a value in the column
A function to display the whole column
This part is nearly finished, we just have to make so adjustments.

We also tried to think about the next steps, to have the real CDataFrame.
So we made a header with how we see the future functions and their parameters but they are subject to change since we are still working on it and 
maybe our views are not as good as we think

Currently :

 A Program to : 
implement
display
add a value
free a column

Two headers :
Header for only one column
Header for the CDataFrame
