Project :
Doing a CDataFrame using the advanced method
So we can have columns with different types of data to have different types in different columns
For this we are using the "union" and the "enum"
To have a single column, we are using different functions to do so
A function to implement the column with a title, a size, a type of data ...
A function to add a value to the column if there is enough space in the column to add it
A function to free the column after freeing all the spaces used for this column
A function to display a value in the column
A function to display the whole column

Currently :

 A Program to : 
implement
display
add a value
free a column

Two headers :
Header for only one column
Header for the CDataFrame
